Q: What is the definition of Server Port?

A Port is a communication endpoint - most modern computers have both physical
    and logical ports where connections are engaged. My computer uses a usb
    port to communicate with my keyboard, my mouse, etc. 

Computers also have logical ports - these function similar to physical ports,
    except they aren't tangible; they function via the internet/networking
    protocols. In networking, a port is a logical construct which identifies
    a specific process or type of service. They are identified for each
    protocol by a 16-bit unsigned number, known as the port number.



Q: What is server port range?

Our computers have a certain range of logical port numbers that they will be
    able to recognize/remember. This number is 65535 - that means there are
    65535 different ports that logical processes can be executed off of this.
    When a new process requires a port for communication with/from my laptop,
    one of these numbers will be selected and used (provided it is not in use
    by another process).


Q: How many bits does the above number represent?

The number 65535 (the number of available ports on a modern pc) represents
    16 bits, or 2 bytes.
